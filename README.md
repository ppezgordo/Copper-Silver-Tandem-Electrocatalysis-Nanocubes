# Cu-Ag-Tandem-Electrocatalysis

The Python code performs X-ray diffraction pattern analysis, including baseline subtraction, application of the Scherrer formula, and calculation of dislocation density, strain, crystallite size, and full width at half maximum (FWHM) using the Williamson-Hall plot. This analysis was conducted in the context of a publication (currently under review) titled "Tandem Electrocatalysis on Cu-Ag Nanostructured Surfaces: Mechanistic Insights and the Role of Silver in Carbon Dioxide Reduction. Open it with a Juypter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.
