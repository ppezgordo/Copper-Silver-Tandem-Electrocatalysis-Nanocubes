# Copper-Silver-Tandem-Electrocatalysis-Nanocubes



This repository contains the data, code, and supporting materials associated with the publication (currently under review) titled "Tandem Electrocatalysis on Cu-Ag Nanostructured Surfaces: Mechanistic Insights and the Role of Silver in Carbon Dioxide Reduction."

## Contents

### 1. Python Code for XRD Analysis
- **`xrd_analysis.py`**: The Python script used for X-ray diffraction pattern analysis, including baseline subtraction, application of the Scherrer formula, and calculation of dislocation density, strain, crystallite size, and full width at half maximum (FWHM) using the Williamson-Hall plot.
- **Usage**: This code can be executed in a Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.

### 2. Supporting Figures
- **`figures/`**: Contains supplementary figures that are referenced in the Supporting Information section but are not included in the main text of the publication.
  - *Example*: `figure_S1.png`, `figure_S2.png`, etc.
  
### 3. Experimental Details
- **`experimental_details/`**: This folder contains detailed descriptions of the experimental procedures, including the synthesis of Cu-Ag nanostructures, characterization methods, and conditions used for the electrochemical experiments.
  - *Example*: `synthesis_protocol.md`, `electrochemical_setup.md`.

### 4. Data Files
- **`data/`**: Raw data and processed results used in the analysis. This includes:
  - **XRD Data**: Files with the raw XRD patterns and processed data.
  - **Electrochemical Data**: Data from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and other related measurements.
  - *Example*: `xrd_raw_data.csv`, `eis_results.csv`, `processed_williamson_hall.csv`.

### 5. Tables and Calculations
- **`tables/`**: Contains tables of calculated values such as strain, dislocation density, and crystallite size, which are referenced in the manuscript and Supporting Information.
  - *Example*: `table_S1.csv`, `table_S2.csv`.

### 6. License
- **`LICENSE`**: This repository is licensed under the MIT License, allowing others to use the materials with proper attribution.
